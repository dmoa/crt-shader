# CRT Shader

### [Definition:](https://docs.libretro.com/shader/crt/)
These shaders attempt to reproduce aspects and characteristics of cathode ray tube (CRT) displays with modern hardware. Most include some sort of scanline effect and often a phosphor mask effect, and they typically do some amount of blurring/blending. Some also include interlacing effects and/or faux barrel distortion (a.k.a., "curvature"). Variations with "glow" or "halation" include a bloom effect that mimics the glow and/or internal reflections of a CRT.
